All the aspects work in the program - I tested each command, and followed the video Prof Tim supplied, where he went through each case for the code.

For the lectureTime input, the program is expecting the format to be "800" instead of "0800" to follow Tim's video example.

All code has been properly commented too.
Exceptions have been properly handled.
